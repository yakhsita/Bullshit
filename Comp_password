# command prompt doesn't give you the passward 
# but it does let you change password

# Step 1
# Open command prompt
# If access denied, open command prompt as Administrator (you'll have that option)

net user <user_name> "<password>"

# sometimes the user_name stays Administrator (for you)

net user Administrator "<password>"   # <- for your computer
